# CI/CD Demo with GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates a minimal CI/CD pipeline for a Python project using GitHub Actions. It automatically runs your Python script (`hello.py`) on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.

## Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow (`main.yml`) performs the following steps:

1. **Trigger**: Executes on push or pull request to the `main` branch.
2. **Checkout**: Clones the repository into the GitHub Actions runner.
3. **Setup Python**: Installs Python 3.11.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Upgrades pip and optionally installs packages from `requirements.txt`.
5. **Run Script**: Executes `hello.py`.

---

## Getting Started

To test or modify the pipeline:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-demo.git
   cd ci-cd-demo
   ```

2. Push changes to `main` or open a pull request — GitHub Actions will trigger automatically.

## Sample Output

When the workflow runs, it prints:
```
CI/CD with Github Actions
done
```

---

## Customization Ideas

You can extend the workflow by adding:

- Unit testing with `pytest`
- Linting with `flake8` or `ruff`
- Packaging or deployment steps (e.g., Docker, SSH, cloud CLI)

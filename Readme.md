# CI/CD Demo with GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates a minimal **CI/CD pipeline** for a Python project using **GitHub Actions**.  
It automatically runs your Python script (`hello.py`) on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow (`main.yml`) performs the following steps:

1. **Trigger:** Runs on every `push` or `pull_request` to the `main` branch.  
2. **Checkout:** Clones the repository into the GitHub Actions runner.  
3. **Setup Python:** Installs **Python 3.11** on the runner.  
4. **Install Dependencies:** Upgrades `pip` and optionally installs packages from `requirements.txt`.  
5. **Run Script:** Executes the Python file `hello.py`.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To test or modify the pipeline locally:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-demo.git
cd ci-cd-demo

# Make changes and push to main
git add .
git commit -m "Update workflow"
git push origin main
````

GitHub Actions will automatically trigger on push or pull request.

## 🧾 Sample Output

When the workflow runs successfully, it prints:

```
CI/CD with GitHub Actions
done
```

## 💡 Customization Ideas

You can enhance this demo workflow by adding:

* ✅ **Testing:** Run unit tests using `pytest`
* 🧹 **Linting:** Use `flake8` or `ruff` for code quality checks
* 🐳 **Docker Integration:** Build and push a Docker image
* ☁️ **Deployment Steps:** Deploy to AWS, Azure, or any cloud provider
